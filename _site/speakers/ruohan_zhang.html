<p>NOIR: Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robot for Everyday Activities</p>

<p><b> Talk Description </b></p>

<p>Neural Signal Operated Intelligent Robots (NOIR), a general-purpose, intelligent brain-robot interface system that enables humans to command robots to perform everyday activities through brain signals. Through this interface, humans communicate their intended objects of interest and actions to the robots using electroencephalography (EEG). The novel system demonstrates success in an expansive array of 20 challenging, everyday household activities, including cooking, cleaning, personal care, and entertainment. The effectiveness of the system is improved by its synergistic integration of robot learning algorithms, allowing for NOIR to adapt to individual users and predict their intentions. This work enhances the way humans interact with robots, replacing traditional channels of interaction with direct, neural communication.</p>
