<p>Collaborative Perception under V2X Communication Limitations</p>

<p><b> Talk Description </b></p>

<p>Collaborative perception (CP) can enhance the perception reliability of autonomous driving, as compared to stand-alone intelligence. However, the limited V2X bandwidth pose challenges on the information exchange, in addition to the dynamic spatial and temporal relationship among sensors on vehicles. This talk will introduce our research efforts toward practical CP, and the simulation platform as well as the datasets we have developed.</p>
